1. Graph is unknown apriori
2. All robots start from root vertex vr
3. @ first visit robot drops beacon at the vertex
4. when robot visits vertex,partially completed graph of robot and vertex are merged using Algorithm 1
5. Partially completed graph is stored as ordered pairs as Gc(Rk)=(Vc(Rk),Ec(Rk)) ,similarly for Gc(Vj)
6. modified incidence matrix stores info according to incidence angles instead of traditional binary data
7. column of incidence matrix->Edge info and Row->Vertex info
8. Completed Edge->2 non-zero elements in column,Unexplored edge->1 positive element and out edge->1 negative element
9. Information is exchanged ONLY when Robot visits vertex having a beacon
10. Each edge traversal is an “update”
11. nth updates for partially completed graph a bot Rk and vj is given by Eq.2
12. Unexplored,out edges are first merged,then next edge traversal is chosen
13. Next Edge Traversal is chosen by the prefrence order:	[my_unexpl,unexpl,out]
14. my_unexplored+other_bots_unexplored=unexplored
15. Exploration Completion condition is as : Eu(Rk)U Eo(Rk)=null set
16. When Robot visits vertex,Gc(vj)=Gc(Rk)
17. robots can select any edge for traversal not just the one connected to the vertex they are on
18. Column Vectors in Incidence matrix are maintained in an ordered fashion as: completed,out,unexplored from left to right
19. @ begining of the exploration,the incidence matrix is initialized as in Eq.14
20. Each row of incidence matrix is assigned a unique vertex tag
21.
